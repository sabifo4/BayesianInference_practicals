# used to label the nodes that are to be calibrated with the calibration you 
# want to use in `MCMCtree` format. If in the same directory,
# you only need to write the name. If in a different directory, please
# type the absolute or relative path to this file.
# The format of this file meets the following criteria:
#
#   - No header.
#   - One row per calibration.
#   - No spaces at all.
#   - The pipe character, "|", is used to separate the flag you are using on
#     the node you want to calibrate (left) from the `MCMCtree` calibration
#     that you will use to calibrate the node (right).
#   - The `MCMCtree` calibrations are written in `MCMCtree` format and with 
#     single quotation marks. No spaces.
#   - No spaces when writing the name of your flag either.
# 
# E.g.: row in this text file to calibrate node "Mammalia". The flag used in the
# tree to locate the node "Mammalia" is "Mammalia" and the `MCMCtree`
# calibration is a soft-bound calibration:
#
# ```
# Mammalia|'B(1.649,2.51254)'
# ```
#`
# If in doubt, please follow the same format as used in the example text 
# file provided.
