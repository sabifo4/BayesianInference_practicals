# TASKS #

# 1. Find tree height. You can use the function `phytools::nodeHeights` to
#    calculate all the heights of the tree. Then, we can extract the maximum
#    height calculated, which will correspond to the length from the root to 
#    the highest tip.
tree_height <- max( phytools::nodeHeights( raw_tt ) ) # 0.3801525

# 2. Get the mean of the calibration set for the root to have the 
#    time for the speciation event at the root, what we will use 
#    to estimate the mean evolutionary rate later. The first set of calibrations
#    has a soft-bound calibration to constraint the root age (i.e., a uniform
#    distribution with a minimum of 37.71 Ma and a 
#    maximum of 66.09 Ma with soft bounds). The average in time unit = 100 Ma 
#    is then 0.519 * 100 Ma. The mean root age following the second set of 
#    calibrations is 0.2338 * 100 Ma (min. age = 20.16 Ma | max. age = 26.6 Ma).
root_age_cal1 <- mean( c(0.3771,0.6609) ) # 0.519 * 100 Ma
root_age_cal2 <- mean( c(0.2016,0.266) )  # 0.2338 * 100 Ma 
# 3. Estimate mean rate based on the two different time units
#
#    tree_height = mean_rate x root_age --> mean_rate = tree_height / root_age
mean_rate_cal1 <- tree_height / root_age_cal1 # 0.7324711 subst/site per time unit
mean_rate_cal2 <- tree_height / root_age_cal2 # 1.625973 subst/site per time unit
# If we want to know the mean rate in subst/site/year, we apply the time unit. We
# We should get the same estimate regardless the time unit used:
#
# Calib1: Time unit 100 May (10^8y): 0.7324711 subst/site/10^8 = 
#                                    = 7.32e-9 subst/site/year
# Cali2: Time unit 100 May (10^8y): 1.625973 subst/site/10^8 = 
#                                    = 1.63e-9 subst/site/year

# 4. Now, we can build the gamma distribution given that we now have an estimate
#    for the mean rate. We will also use `alpha = 2` as we will start with a 
#    vague distribution. Nevertheless, if you were very sure about the mean 
#    rate, you could build a more constraint prior.
#
#    mean_Gamma = mean_rate = alpha / beta --> beta = alpha / mean_rate
alpha <- 2
beta_cal1  <- alpha/mean_rate_cal1 # 2.730483 ~ 2.7
beta_cal2  <- alpha/mean_rate_cal2 # 1.230033 ~ 1.2

# We can plot these distributions
